Proud Software Engineer based in Dublin, Ireland. 
Working with software development since 2006 had the chance to work 
with an extensive range of solutions for small and large companies, 
from design until getting the product to the final step of production.
Have you heard about the continues learning, I see myself as one of 
those, if you ask what I am doing in my free time, 
I will probably answer that I'm studying something new or 
I'm in the Gym. Currently, focusing my time in research/study 
new technologies always thinking about the next disruption and how to get there.


## Getting Start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
