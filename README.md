I am a software engineer who can be described as a serious enthusiast of technology, fortunate to work with one of my biggest passions: software development. Finding different ways to solve different problems.

Based in Dublin, Ireland, I have been working with software development since 2006, working with an extensive range of small to large solutions, from designing the software until getting it out the door.

## Getting Start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
