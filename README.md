## Summary

I am a software engineer who can be described as a serious enthusiast of technology, fortunate to work with one of my
biggest passions: software development. Finding different ways to solve different problems.

Based in Dublin, Ireland, I have been working with software development since 2006, working with an extensive range of
small to large solutions, from designing the software until getting it out the door.
